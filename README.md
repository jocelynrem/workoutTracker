### Description

An app that allows a user to view, create, and track daily workouts.


### Usage
To use this application, you need to open the app from heroku and select the new workout button. Continue to build your workout or return the the main page and add multiple workouts. Once you are done, all of the totals for the last workout added will be displayed on the main screen, but if you go to the dashboard, you will see the stats page with the last 7 workouts displayed.
